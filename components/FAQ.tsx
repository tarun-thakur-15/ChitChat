      <>
        ChatShat is a live chatting web app that lets people connect and
        communicate instantly in real time. Itâ€™s lightweight, fast, and built
        from scratch using modern technologies like Next.js, Node.js, and
        Socket.io. You can send messages, share media, and chat with anyone
        without unnecessary clutter.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Are my chats private?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes. your messages on ChatShat are kept private and handled securely. We
        store conversations safely in our database so they can be delivered
        reliably and accessed later if needed. ChatShat does not sell, share, or
        use your messages for advertising or tracking purposes. While chats are
        not end-to-end encrypted, we take all reasonable steps to protect your
        data from unauthorized access.

    question: "Can I share images, videos, or documents?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Absolutely! ChatShat supports sending media files like images, videos,
        audio, and documents. Files are uploaded safely and delivered through
        our system so that the receiver can view or download them seamlessly.

    ),
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to create an account to chat?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Yes â€” youâ€™ll need to create a simple account with your name, email, and
        password. This helps us keep your data safe and lets you access your
        chats anytime. We donâ€™t ask for unnecessary information â€” just enough to
        make chatting secure and smooth.
      </>
